# HORM Diagramming Tool (HORM-DT)

## About

HORM-DT is a domain-specific modelling tool for visualising cybersecurity-related user journeys. The main target group of the tool are SMEs' employees. The use of the tool and the produced models aim at raising cybersecurity awareness in SMEs so that they can visualize their practices and the potential cyber threats and identify the gaps so that they can develop up-to-date or new cyber-risk strategies in an informed way. 

The tool is developed as part of the [Human and Organizational Risk Modelling (HORM)](https://cjml.no/horm/), i.e., a comprehensible and easy to use cybersecurity-related framework for capturing risks ordinary people may be exposed to. HORM is based on the formalism of the [Customer Journey modelling Language (CJML)](https://cjml.no/) as extended by formalism from the [CORAS language](https://coras.sourceforge.net/coras_language.html), so that it can address cybersecurity-related user journeys. 

HORM-DT is developed for the EU-funded project [CyberKit4SME](https://www.cyberkit4sme.eu) (grant agreement 883188) and as part of Sefat Noor Orni's MSc project.
